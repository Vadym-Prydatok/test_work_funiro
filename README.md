The project is developed using React and TypeScript technologies. To manage the state of one of the sliders, I utilize the powerful Redux Toolkit library. The website features four unique sliders, including three custom ones and one SlickSlider, which adds diversity to the content.

Animations on the website are implemented through the AOS library, providing expressiveness and dynamism to the page. There is also the capability to add items to favorites and the cart, which is executed easily and intuitively. When clicking on the icon, an interactive menu appears, allowing you to remove added items.

The website follows a 'mobile-first' design principle, ensuring optimal appearance and functionality on any device, regardless of its size.
